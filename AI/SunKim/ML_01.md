# Machine Learning

- Limitations of explicit programming

  Spam Filter: many rules

  Automatic driving: too many rules

- "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed" - Arthuer Samuel(1959)



## Supervised / Unsupervised learning

- Supervised learning

  learning with labeled examples - training sets.(is dog? is cat?)

- Unsupervised learning: un-labeled data

  Google news grouping

  Word clustering

### Supervised learning

Most common problem type in ML

- Image labeling: learning from tagged images
- Email spam filter: learning from labeled (spam  or ham) email
- Predicting exam score: learning from previous exam score and time spent

*training set* 




#### Types of supervised learning

1. Predicting final exam score based on time spent
   - regression
2. Pass / non-pass based on time spent
   - binary classification
3. Letter grade (A, B, C, E and F) based on time spent
   - multi-label classification



## Tensor

```
[ [1,2,3], [1,3,4] ]
```

- Ranks. (n dimensional array ) -> 2

- Shapes. (number of elements) -> 3

- Types. (float32)
